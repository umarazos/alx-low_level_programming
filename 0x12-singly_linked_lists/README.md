0x12. C - Singly linked lists
Singly Linked List in C is one of the simplest linear data structures, that we use for storing our data in an easy and efficient way.
The first node is called the head; it points to the first node of the list and helps us access every other element in the list. The last node, also sometimes called the tail, points to NULL which helps us in determining when the list ends.
Using a singly-linked list, its easier to go about inserting, modifing and even removing element (in this case Node) in a data structure.
This is an ALX project to implement the most common use cases of the singly-linked list.
